 * Content Streaming (it.stefanochizzolini.clown.documents.contents)
  * [change] class composition.ContentBuilder
   * [fix] showXObject(PdfName,RectangularShape,double): context height is now referred to the context box. Symptom: wrong external graphics positioning on a template when no pages are present in the document yet. Cause: showXObject wrongly referred to the generic page height of the document, ignoring current stream context.
