 * Utility (it.stefanochizzolini.clown.util)
  * [add] class io.BigEndianBinaryReader: big-endian parsing is necessary for TrueType fonts (standard binary reader supports little-endian order only).
 * Byte Streaming (it.stefanochizzolini.clown.bytes)
  * [change] class Buffer
   * [fix] [1668291] ReadByte(): IndexOutOfRangeException is properly managed. Symptom: IndexOutOfRangeException was thrown in case the end of the buffer was reached. Cause: IndexOutOfRangeException was not trapped.
 * Serialization (it.stefanochizzolini.clown.tokens)
  * [change] class Parser
   * [fix] [1668410] MoveNext(): parsing of float numbers has been corrected. Symptom: parsing of float numbers was buggy. Cause: the default localized number format was inadvertently used instead of the canonical format (decimal separator was unpredictable).
 * Content Streaming (it.stefanochizzolini.clown.documents.contents)
  * [change] class tokens.Parser
   * [fix] [1668410] MoveNext(): parsing of float numbers has been corrected. Symptom: parsing of float numbers was buggy. Cause: the default localized number format was inadvertently used instead of the canonical format (decimal separator was unpredictable).
